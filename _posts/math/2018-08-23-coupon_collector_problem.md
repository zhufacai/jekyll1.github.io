The coupon collector's problem describes the following question: there are $n$ different types of
coupons and the collector will receive a random coupon every time, what is the expected trials
that the collector can collect all $n$ types of coupons? We can conclude that the expected trails
grows as $\mathcal{O}(n\log{n})$.

The Distribution of Trails for a new Coupon
-------------------------------------------

Let $T$ be the time to collect all $n$ types of coupons, and $t_i$ be the time to collect a new
coupon after $i-1$ coupons have been collected. We can see that the probability of $t_i$ satisfies
_geometric distribution_ with $p_i = \frac{n-(i-1)}{n}$, then we conclude

$$E(t_i) = \frac{1}{p_i} = \frac{n}{n-(i-1)}$$

We also obviously know that $t_i$ and $t_j$ are independent. Thus

$$\begin{aligned}E(T) &= \sum{E(t_i)} \\
                      &= \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{p_2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{p_n} \\
                      &= \frac{n}{n} + \frac{n}{n-1} + \cdots + \frac{n}{1} \\
                      &= n \cdot (\frac{1}{n} + \frac{n}{n-1} + \cdots + \frac{1}{1}) \\
                      &\simeq n\log{n} + \gamma n + \frac{1}{2} + O(\frac{1}{n})
\end{aligned}$$

The variance of the random variable $T$ can be calculated as (since $t_i$ are independent)

$$\begin{aligned}Var(T) &= \sum{Var(t_i)} \\
                        &= \frac{1-p_1}{p_1^2} + \frac{1-p_2}{p_2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1-p_n}{p_n^2} \\
                        &<= \frac{n^2}{n^2} + \frac{n^2}{(n-1)^2} + \cdots + \frac{n^2}{1^2} \\
                        &<= n^2 \cdot (\frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \cdots + \frac{1}{n^2}) \\
                        &= n^2 \cdot \frac{\pi^2}{6}
\end{aligned}$$

A classical puzzle that can be modeled as Coupon Collector's problem is that, for a cubic dice, we
are expected to get all six points after how many trails? The answer for the question should be

$$\sum_1^6{\frac{6}{i}} \simeq 14.7 \simeq 15$$

Generalization
--------------

The Coupon Collector's Problem has been generalized as the expected trails of collect $m$ copy of
each $n$ coupons. When $m=2$, the problem is also called _The Double Dixie Cup Problem_[^9].
The expectation of $T_m$ satisfies

$$E(T_m) = n\log{n} + (m-1) n \log{\log{n}} + O(n), \texttt{as}\, n \to \infty$$

In the more general case, when $p_i$ is nonuniform, Philippe Flajolet gives[^1]

$$E(T) = \int_0^\infty{(1-\prod_{i=1}^n{1-e^{-p_i \cdot t}})}\,dt$$

If the collector receives $d$ coupons each run[^6], in the asymptotic case the $m$ copy of of each $n$
coupons will be collected expected within time

$$E(T_m) = n\log{n}/d + (m-1) (n/d) \log{\log{n}} + O(n \cdot m)$$

The Coupon Collector's Problem can also be generalized as stochastic process[^2][^3][^4]. The paper from
_MAT_[^7] also gives exhaustive analysis of this problem. The expectation can also be expressed using
the Stirling numbers[^5][^8].
